# python-mailsearcher
Python script to search valid mail addresses for each name in Excel file

## How it works:
First you need an Excel file like this:
## ![excel](https://i.imgur.com/2N7s6OA.png)
Then you need an app password from Google https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

After that you just run script, log in to your account and enter the name of your Excel file (ex. "contacts.xlsx")
